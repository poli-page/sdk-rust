# scripts/check-contract-version.sh — the release's major.minor must be the
# pinned API contract's.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-contract-version.sh X.Y.Z   (or vX.Y.Z, or a prerelease)
#
# The SDK shares its major.minor with the Poli Page API, so a release X.Y.z
# must pass the API contract X.Y. This reads the contract commit pinned in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (never its `# vX.Y.Z` comment), checks that every
# workflow pins that same commit, lists the contract repository's tags, and
# fails unless that commit carries a stable tag vX.Y.Z with the release's
# major.minor. Patch numbers are free.
#
# Run by scripts/release.sh and by the Release workflow. API_CONTRACT_REMOTE
# overrides the contract repository (a test points it at a local one).
